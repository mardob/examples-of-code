# examples-of-code
This is example of my old previous work done during university at my free time. It is website where I did backend development. This was done in my free time while actual website was my friends idea. Its job is to let users to create tests for translations. I took it as chance to practice my skills with languages I never used before PHP and MYSQL and also to get more experience with javascript that I used before on few ocasions. This is second version of this website first one followed same idea but was made in javascript alone and it only displayed tests created beforehand. As I had no previous experience with PHP or databases or any official guidlines it was more about mechanical skills and understing of languages and their usage rather than good design. This is why this website has many design issues especially if this website was made into bigger project. I am aware of these design isues and it is possible I will come back to this project at some point and try to correct them. I would rather though continue on different projects. Example of these isues would be for example usage of Text variable to store small pieces of text.
