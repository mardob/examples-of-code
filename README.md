# examples-of-code
These are some examples of my previous work. They are website that I worked on for my friend that had idea of website with tests. I mainly took it as a chance to develop new skills during summer.
Design and thus HtML and CSS were done by my friend while I worked on PHP, MYSQL and in previous versions on Javascript.
This website was done before I was officialy introduced to MYSQL or PHP as such I made design decisions that can be seen as faulty. It still taught me a lot about back end development.
